                    <b>Cats</b>, also called <b>domestic cats</b><i>(Felis catus)</i>,
                    are small, <a href="#">carnivorous mammals</a>, of the

                    Cats have been <a href="#">domesticated</a> (tamed) for nearly
                    10,000 years.<a href="#"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Domestic cats may be called 'house cats' when kept as indoor
                    <a href="#">pets.<sup>[6]</sup></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are one of the most popular <a href="#">pets</a> in the world.
                    <a href="#">Humans</a> keep them for hunting rodents and as friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are also farm cats, which keep <a href="#">rodents</a> away;
                    and <a href="#">feral cats</a>, which are domestic cats that live
                    away from humans.<a href="#"><sup>[7]</sup></a>

                    A cat is sometimes called a kitty. A young cat is called a kitten.<a href="#"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
                    There are about 92 breeds of cat.<a href="#"><sup>[9]</sup></a>

                    The word 'cat' is also used for other <a href="#">felines</a>.
                    Felines are usually called either <a href="#">big cats</a> or
                    <a href="#">small cats</a>. The big, wild cats are well known:

                    In the past, mostly in <a href="#">Egypt</a>, people kept domestic cats because they
                    hunted and ate <a href="#">mice</a> and <a href="#">rats</a>. Today, people often keep cats as pets.
                    There are also domestic cats which live without being cared for by
                    people. These cats are called "feral cats" or "stray cats".

                <p>
                    The oldest evidence of cats kept as pets is from the <a href="#">Mediterranean</a>
                    island of <a href="#">Cyprus</a>, around 7500 BC. <a href="#">Ancient Egyptians</a> worshipped cats
                    as gods, and often <a href="#">mummified</a> them so they could be with their owners

                    Today, special food for cats is widely available in developed
                    countries. Proper feeding will help a cat live longer compared to
                    hunting or being fed table scraps. Not correctly feeding a cat can
                    lead to problems (see below for health concerns).
