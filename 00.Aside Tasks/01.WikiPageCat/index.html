                    are small, <a href="#">carnivorous mammals</a>, of the

                    Cats have been <a href="#">domesticated</a> (tamed) for nearly
                    10,000 years.<a href="#"><sup>[5]</sup></a>

                    Domestic cats may be called 'house cats' when kept as indoor
                    <a href="#">pets.<sup>[6]</sup></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are one of the most popular <a href="#">pets</a> in the world.
                    <a href="#">Humans</a> keep them for hunting rodents and as friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are also farm cats, which keep <a href="#">rodents</a> away;
                    and <a href="#">feral cats</a>, which are domestic cats that live
                    away from humans.<a href="#"><sup>[7]</sup></a>

                    The word 'cat' is also used for other <a href="#">felines</a>.
                    Felines are usually called either <a href="#">big cats</a> or

                    In the past, mostly in Egypt, people kept domestic cats because they
                    hunted and ate mice and rats. Today, people often keep cats as pets.
                    There are also domestic cats which live without being cared for by
                    people. These cats are called "feral cats" or "stray cats".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The oldest evidence of cats kept as pets is from the Mediterranean
                    island of Cyprus, around 7500 BC. Ancient Egyptians worshipped cats
                    as gods, and often mummified them so they could be with their owners
                    "for all of eternity".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, special food for cats is widely available in developed
                    countries. Proper feeding will help a cat live longer compared to
                    hunting or being fed table scraps. Not correctly feeding a cat can
                    lead to problems (see below for health concerns).

                    Cats cannot taste sweet foods (with sugar) because of a mutation
                    (change) in their ancestors which removed the ability to taste sweet
                    things.

                <p class="first-paragraph">
                    Cats have anatomy similar to the other members of the genus Felis.
                    The genus has extra lumbar (lower back) and thoracic (chest)
                    vertebrae. This helps to explain the cat's spinal mobility and
                    flexibility. Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the
                    shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones. These allow cats to pass
                    their body through any space into which they can fit their
                    heads.[10]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye
                    sockets and a powerful and specialized jaw.[11]:35 Compared to other
                    felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth: this is an
                    adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents.[12] Cats, like
                    dogs, walk directly on their toes, with the bones of their feet
                    making up the lower part of the visible leg.[13]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cats walk very precisely. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they
                    use a "pacing" gait (walking style); that is, they move the two legs
                    on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This
                    trait is shared with camels and giraffes. As a walk speeds up into a
                    trot, a cat's gait will change to be a "diagonal" gait, similar to
                    that of most other mammals: the diagonally opposite hind and
                    forelegs will move at the same time.[14] Most cats have five claws
                    on their front paws, and four on their rear paws.[15] On the inside
                    of the front paws there is something which looks like a sixth
                    "finger". This special feature on the inside of the wrists is the
                    carpal pad. The carpal pad is also found on other cats and on dogs.
